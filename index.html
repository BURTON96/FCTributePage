                    Captain Raymond Jacob Holt is one of the main characters of the show. 
                    He is the current Captain of the 99th Precinct and was formerly a uniformed officer. 
                    Outwardly he is strict, hardworking, stoic, staunchly professional, and a stickler for the rules. 
                    Inwardly, he is a warm, empathetic, devoted, and kind-hearted man who cares deeply about the officers and employees under his command and frequently participates in office antics,
                    competitions, and pranks. Though he is often lampooned by his colleagues for his lack of displaying emotion or facial expressions, he is held in the highest regard by them and has developed close relationships with most of them.

            <h2> Biography</h2>
            <hr>
                <p>
                Holt's age and birthday have never been established but he is described by Det. Peralta as being of "advanced age". 
                He is from Brooklyn, New York, and grew up in an upper-middle-class household with his sister Debbie, his mother 
                Laverne Holt—a judge on the ninth circuit court—and his unnamed father. An introverted child, Holt largely kept 
                to himself and developed a personality similar to that of his mother. Very little else has been revealed about his
                 upbringing; however, he does reveal that when he was seven years old, he would sneak into his father's study and  
                peek at his father's antiqued globes as a substitute for playing with toys. Holt also kept a diary in his youth.

                When Holt grew up, he went on to join the NYPD sometime in the late 1970s or early 1980s. He came out as gay in 1987. 
                As a black, gay police officer, Holt experienced an avalanche of discrimination, profiling, homophobia, and slander
                 for many years but fought through it all anyway with his head held high and even went on to marry Kevin Cozner, a 
                 classics professor. In addition to decades of police work, during which time he arrested over six hundred people and
                  caught a number of very high profile criminals (e.g. The Disco Strangler), Holt spent eight unhappy years in the  
                public affairs office all the while fighting to become eligible for a command of his own.
